**Fig.1.** An illustration of the proposed unsupervised hyperspectral super-resolution networks, called Coupled Unmixing Nets with Cross-Attention **(CUCaNet)**, inspired by spectral unmixing techniques, which mainly consists of two important modules: cross-attention and spatial-spectral consistency.

## Training
Please simply run `./Main_CAVE.py` demo to reproduce our HSISR results on two HSIs (*fake and real food* and *chart and staffed toy*) of the [CAVE dataset](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral) (Using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) with `Python 3.7` implemented on `Windows` OS).

- Before: For the required packages, please refer to detailed `.py` files.
- Parameters: The trade-off parameters as `train_opt.lambda_*` could be better tuned and the network hyperparameters are flexible.
- Results: Please see the five evaluation metrics (PSNR, SAM, ERGAS, SSIM, and UIQI) logged in `./checkpoints/CAVE_*name*/precision.txt` and the output `.mat` files saved in `./Results/CAVE/`.
- Runtime: ca. 1 hour per HSI using a single GTX2080.
